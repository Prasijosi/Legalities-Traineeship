# 7.Fibonacci Sequence Generator   

"""
The Fibonacci sequence is a set of numbers in which each is the sum of the two numbers before it.
It starts with zeros and ones. So, the sequence proceeds as follows:
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...
"""

"""
Recursion is a programming approach that involves calling a function on itself to solve a smaller version of the same problem.
A recursive function calls itself to calculateÂ the previous two Fibonacci numbers until it reaches the base cases (0 and 1).
